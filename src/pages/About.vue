      >Stephanie H. Edwards (Stephie-Jo) formed James River Women’s Rugby
      Football Club (JWRFC) in the Spring of 2001. Before that, there was not a
      women’s club team in Richmond, VA. With the assistance of the James River
      Men’s and United Men’s RFC, JRWRFC was able to gather interested players
      from the area. Enough players came out to establish the need to schedule
      practices. With the enthusiasm of these new players, James River entered a
      team in the Cape Fear Sevens Tournament that summer. There was a positive
      reaction from the players to continue with a team in the fall. James River
      Men’s RFC, our established brother club, allowed us to use a portion of
      their field and assisted in coaching the new players during the fall
      season. Schedule practices began in mid-August and continued through the
      first part of November. Eight scheduled matches were played and several
      scrimmages with Virginia Commonwealth University Women’s Football Club
      were organized and executed. The team also participated in the Sandy Lee
      State Cup in late October. After a successful trial run, the women decided
      to move forward with the club. On January 15, 2002, the club held its
      inaugural Annual General Meeting (AGM). The club voted in Shannon Plum as
      the newly elected president; as well as, its first executive board. </v-card-text
