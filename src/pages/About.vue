      >Stephanie H. Edwards (Stephie-Jo) formed James River Women’s Rugby
      Football Club (JWRFC) in the Spring of 2001. Before that, there was not a
      women’s club team in Richmond, VA. <br />With the assistance of the James
      River Men’s and United Men’s RFC, JRWRFC was able to gather interested
      players from the area. Enough players came out to establish the need to
      schedule practices. With the enthusiasm of these new players, James River
      entered a team in the Cape Fear Sevens Tournament that summer.<br />
      There was a positive reaction from the players to continue with a team in
      the fall. James River Men’s RFC, our established brother club, allowed us
      to use a portion of their field and assisted in coaching the new players
      during the fall season. <br />
      Schedule practices began in mid-August and continued through the first
      part of November. Eight scheduled matches were played and several
      scrimmages with Virginia Commonwealth University Women’s Football Club
      were organized and executed. The team also participated in the Sandy Lee
      State Cup in late October. After a successful trial run, the women decided
      to move forward with the club.<br />
      On January 15, 2002, the club held its inaugural Annual General Meeting
      (AGM). The club voted in Shannon Plum as the newly elected president; as
      well as, its first executive board. </v-card-text
